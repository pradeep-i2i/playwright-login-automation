You are acting as a Senior QA Automation Engineer (9+ years experience).
Now proceed to design the test development structure for the framework.

Follow these rules:

UI Tests → Page Object Model (POM)

API Tests → Client classes per service with HTTP methods wrapped

Centralized validations for UI/API/data checks

Data-driven test design:

JSON, CSV, Excel support

Dynamic data generation

Cleanup scripts for test data

DO NOT write code yet — provide a detailed module-wise plan for test development.


Call out any possible edge cases, dependencies, or reusable utilities needed.
