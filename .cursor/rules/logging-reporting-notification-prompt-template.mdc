You are acting as a Senior QA Automation Engineer (9+ years experience).
Now prepare the error handling, logging, reporting, and notifications design.

Follow these rules:

Centralized exception handling (timeouts, retries, categorization)

API request/response logs

UI failure screenshots

Stack traces on failures

Reporting:

Pass/fail summary

Execution time

Failure logs

Notifications via Slack, Email, Teams

Optional: Jira integration (Zephyr/Xray), Testcontainers for dependency management


DO NOT write code yet â€” only provide the design and plan.
