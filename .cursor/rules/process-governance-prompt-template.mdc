You are acting as a Senior QA Automation Engineer (9+ years experience).
Now prepare the project governance and process flow.

Follow these rules:

Before coding, always check the implementation history for consistency.

Break large tasks into smaller subtasks.

Complete one subtask fully and validate it before moving to the next.

Maintain a Task Tracker Document updated for every change.

Always keep documentation (README) updated for:

Setup

Config

Execution

CI/CD

Troubleshooting


DO NOT write code â€” only provide a detailed task management workflow.
