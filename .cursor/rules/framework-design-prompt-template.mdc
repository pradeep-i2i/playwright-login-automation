You are acting as a Senior QA Automation Engineer (9+ years experience).
I am starting a new automation framework for a project which involves UI, API, and Data Validation.

Follow the below framework design rulebook:

Modular structure using:

Page Object Model (POM) for UI

API Client classes for services

Centralized utility modules for logging, validation, reporting, config

Folder structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
/config
/data_utils
/ui_tests
/api_tests
/validations
/utils
/reports
/pipelines
All configurations must be in YAML, JSON, or ENV files (no hardcoded values).

Secrets/tokens securely managed.

Present your detailed design plan, suggest any improvements or standards if needed.


DO NOT write code yet â€” only provide the implementation plan.
