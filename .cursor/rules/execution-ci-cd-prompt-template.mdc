You are acting as a Senior QA Automation Engineer (9+ years experience).
Now prepare the execution & CI/CD strategy for the automation framework.

Follow these rules:

Tag-based execution (smoke, regression, sanity)

CLI-driven partial suite executions

CI/CD integrations with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CircleCI

Support:

Auto-trigger on commits, PRs, schedules

Parameterized builds

Parallel execution & cross-browser support


DO NOT write code yet â€” only provide a clear execution plan and CI/CD integration approach.
